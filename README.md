omp4j [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/omp4j/omp4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/omp4j/omp4j)
=====
Lightweight Java OMP-like preprocessor written in Scala and Java. The input of the preprocessor are valid Java source files with proper directives (i.e. `// omp ...` comments). One can use omp4j either as "blackbox" compiler (preprocessor using javac) or as pure preprocessor. In latter case the output is valid paralellized Java source files.

Usage
-----
The described method is for UNIX-like systems. Microsoft Windows are supported though, nevertheless the users are expected to figure the installation steps by theirselves.

### Prerequisites
- supported JDK (see tested JDKs on [Travis-CI](https://github.com/omp4j/omp4j/blob/master/.travis.yml))
- Scala (tested version `2.9.2`)
- sbt (tested version `0.13.5`)
- git

**Note:** Even though only `scala 2.9.2` is required to run `sbt` properly, using current ScalaTest determines `sbt` to use `scala 2.10.3`. If you don't have this version installed `sbt` will download it by itself. This scala version will be installed only in the project directory and **will not affect** any other project or system itself.

**Note:** After the assemblation, **only proper JDK is required** to run `.jar` as all dependencies are packed into the package. One can distribute `.jar` to machines not having scala/ANTLR/ScalaTest installed at all.

### Fetching code
```
$ git clone git@github.com:omp4j/omp4j.git --recursive
$ cd omp4j
```

### Compilation
```
$ sbt compile
```

### Unit testing
Run ScalaTest unit testing. If ScalaTest isn't installed, it is downloaded by `sbt` automatically.
```
$ sbt test
```

### Deployment
```
$ sbt assembly
```
This command creates `.jar` package in `target/scala-<version>/`. One can simply run it on any regular JVM (even without installed scala!) using `java -jar <generated-package.jar> <params>`. This package is ready for deployment as has no further dependencies.

For the future references we assume that the user has created shell alias `omp4j` invoking `java -jar <generated-package.jar>` with all passed parameters. The alias creation depends on the employed shell.

### Run
```
$ omp4j <args>
```
Where `<args>` are passed arguments. See [tutorial](http://www.omp4j.org/tutorial) for supported options and arguments.

omp4j may be invoked also by using `$ sbt run <args>`, however this option is not suggested. It should be employed only for development purposes since it perform significantly more poorly and the runtime library must be present in the classpath.

### API reference
```
$ sbt doc
```
This command creates directory `target/scala-<version>/api/` including file `index.html`. One can simply open it in web browser in order to browse API reference.

### Directive Programming
The preprocessor accepts a serial Java source code which is decorated by directives. Refer to [project tutorial] in order to obtain directive-related information and usefull examples.
